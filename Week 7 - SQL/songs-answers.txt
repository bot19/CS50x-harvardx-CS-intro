How would you characterize their audio aura?

Data:
+-------------------+-------------+--------------+
| AVG(danceability) | AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) |
+-------------------+-------------+--------------+
| 0.71646           | 0.65906     | 0.484443     |

I looks like this user likes dancing music on the higher end of energic but neutral in terms of positivity-neither somber or happy/upbeat.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The issue here is for example, if the user happens to like both songs that they can dance to, and songs that aren't meant for dancing.

In other words, their tastes lie at both extremes of a metric (or a large delta between), thus an average would not be indicative of their preference.

Right now, if the "Audio Aura" takes into account a single value across these 3 metrics, perhaps an improvement would be the accommodation for min-max value instead.

Suppose the AA comes out as a colour gradient mixture of potentially 3 colours, now it could accommodate 6!

If the delta is small in each metric, it would produce roughly the same result as previous, but if not, the 4/5/6 colours would be more representative!

Or even if these 3 values only inform an algorithm that produces the colour gradients, having 6 values would be more accurate!
