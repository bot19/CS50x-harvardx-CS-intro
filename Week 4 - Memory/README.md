## Sort

1. assignment 1 of 3
2. [requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/3/sort/)
3. TL;DR given various size data sets, sorted in various ways, run unnamed sorting algorithms and determine which algorithm sorted the data by the completion time (ref upper/lower bounds in the "order of" time)
4. [Sort.md](Sort.md)

## Runoff

1. assignment 3 of 3
2. [requirements](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/3/runoff/)
3. TL;DR Like Plurality, except now voters have preferences for each candidate. Determine the winning candidate or candidates by eliminating least voted for candidates
