# CS50's Intro to Computer Science 2025

HarvardX CS50x - CS50's Introduction to Computer Science 2025 (3 weeks in 2024).

Will hold my assignments and detailed working notes (click on each week to see its README).

More info if interested:

Having come from a bachelors of Multimedia Design, I got my programming start from a mixture of building websites as a hobby (2005-2010 era), 1 programming subject from Mechatronics, 2 subjects from Multimedia Design (web and flash, lol) and finally a part-time job building websites and implementing them into CMSs.

I went on to do well enough but I could never get away from feeling like I was working in silos. Now with some free time on my hands I'm patching up any gaps in the fundamentals, back-end, devOps and AI, on my journey to becoming a Software Engineer from a UI designer and front-end devoper.

## üèÅ Features/objectives

1. 10 weeks of problem sets (multiple per week)
2. a final project (might be in a separate repo, will be linked)
3. problem solving notes
4. mostly C, python, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS

## üìù Notes

1. disclaimer: I haven't worked in C, python or SQL before, when completing assignments, I'll be utilising what I've been taught at that point in time.
2. so far, for C, I've been using the course's Cloud VSCode environment (as recommended), so only the code and working notes will be included, if you wish to run any of the code you'll have to figure that out. All of the code was working and successfully submitted at the time of commit.
3. Thanks for visiting.
